PURPOSE: Calculates shortest path lengths according to Dijkstra's algorithm.

USAGE:   awk -v u=<start> [-v t=<end>] [-v dir=<direction>] -f dijkstra.awk <file>
         awk -f dijkstra.awk help

         file       input file containing graph specification, i.e. definition of edges
         start      label of starting vertex
         end        label of ending vertex; if not given, the shortest lengths for ALL vertices are calculated
         direction  U|D (default U); graph should be regarded as Undirected or Directed

EXAMPLE: awk -v u=a -v t=g -v dir=D -f dijkstra.awk graphdef.txt

         starting (ending) vertex is "a"("g"); graph defined by "graphdef.txt" should be regarded as directed
